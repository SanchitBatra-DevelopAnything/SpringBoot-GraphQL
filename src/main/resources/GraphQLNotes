GQL Works with schema (schema.graphqls file in graphQL folder)
2 types of commands : Query(R) & Mutation(CUD)

type User {
    field:datatype, (! means it cant be null),
    field2:datatype
    mappings , []-> this is an array
}

mutations me CUD , query me R

query and mutations are mapped through controllers.

@MutationMapping , function name should be same as Mutation name you gave in file of schema.

@MutationMapping(name = "actual mutation name in the graphqls file")
if function name cant be same as mutation name mentioned in schema file.

Instead of @ResponseBody se poori entity bne
@Argument se ek ek key map ho skti hai
